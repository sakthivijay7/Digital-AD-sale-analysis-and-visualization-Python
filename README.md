# Python-Visualization
Python codes to dataset to be visualization and model train to predict
# Features
>Small and different charts to be visual output of the datasets,
>Model  dataset to be trained and predict new inputs to then output will get
>Using all different classification algorithm to model to be train which one more accuracy it to use for prediction for more accurate result 
# Tools used
1."Python Idle" or "Pycharm",
2.Python Libraries 'Pandas' 'Numpy' 'matplotlib' 'seaborn' 'scikit-learn' .
# How to use
Download dataset.csv and python.py files
# Keep in mind
Model trained if using more accuracy algorithm some times biased then use for prediction above 75% to 80% < 95%
